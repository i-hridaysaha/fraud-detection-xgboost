"""
monitoring.py — production monitoring for a deployed fraud model. Two
distinct failure modes are tracked, since they require different responses:

  1. DATA DRIFT: the distribution of INPUT features shifts (e.g. average
     transaction amount rises due to inflation, a new merchant category
     appears). Detected via Population Stability Index (PSI) per feature.
     Response: investigate upstream data changes; may not need retraining.

  2. CONCEPT DRIFT / PERFORMANCE DECAY: the relationship between features
     and fraud itself changes (fraud rings adopt a new pattern). Detected
     by tracking precision/recall against a lagged ground-truth label feed
     (chargebacks/confirmed fraud reports arrive days/weeks after the
     transaction). Response: retrain.
