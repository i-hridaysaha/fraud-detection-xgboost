"""
api.py — FastAPI service exposing the trained XGBoost fraud model for
real-time scoring. Designed for the shape of request a payment/transaction
system would send at authorization time.

Two ways to supply the time-dependent features (velocity, recency, device):

  1. Store-backed (production path): set "use_feature_store": true and the
     service fetches those features from the online feature store
     (src/online_features.py) using the transaction's ids — computed live from
     per-customer streaming state, not passed by the caller. Only the raw
     transaction fields (V1-V28, Amount, ids, timestamp) are required.

  2. Caller-provided (legacy path, default): the caller passes all streaming
     features pre-computed in `features`. Kept for backward compatibility.

Run:
    uvicorn src.api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --workers 4

Example request (store-backed):
    POST /score
    {
      "transaction_id": "TXN_00012345",
      "customer_id": "CUST_004821",
      "merchant_id": 118,
      "merchant_category": "electronics",
      "device_id": "DEV_002_CUST_004821",
      "amount": 482.10,
      "timestamp": "2026-07-09T14:32:00Z",
      "use_feature_store": true,
      "ingest": true,
      "features": { "V1": -1.2, "V2": 0.5, ... }   # V1-V28 only in this mode
    }

    ships it. A running process keeps serving the version it loaded — a
    deliberate, safe default: no mid-flight model swaps under load. A real
    deployment would trigger a rolling restart on promotion (or add a guarded
    hot-reload endpoint); noted here rather than hidden.
